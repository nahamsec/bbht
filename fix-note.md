While i was installing bbht it was not creating ".bash_profile" aliases, i had to fix the code everytime is create a vps or vm. 
And now im facing problem while installing bbht GOLANG tools as GOLANG version 1.17.5 does'nt suppport 'go get', instead it used 'go install github.com/user/toolName@latest'

So i made some small changes to use it in easy was! 

# Fix 1 : Bash profile
# Fix 2 : Golang tools installation
# Fix 3 : Golang version updated
